See it in action:
 
 Production branch (prod) - [https://be-dice.com](https://be-dice.com).

Master branch (dev), on heroku free plan, so might need time to start up if not used in some time - [http://dev.be-dice.com](http://dev.be-dice.com).


The production branch currently is the project as I submit it for the Node Knockout hackathon, with a few bug fixes.
